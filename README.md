# Graphene-Nanotube
Build a graphene sheet and roll it up in order to construct a carbon nanotube!

## Description
In this project, a graphene sheet was constructed and rolled up to form a carbon nanotube. For the graphene sheet, orientation was determined with the origin set at the atom located at the leftmost corner of the sheet. For the nanotube, the z-axis passed through the center of the tube, and the x-axis through the atom originally at the origin. All lengths were measured in units of the carbon-carbon bond length, meaning bonded atoms were a distance of 1.0 apart.

To visually represent the graphene sheet and its corresponding carbon nanotube, four functions were coded within a Python script named `nano_plot.py`. These functions visually represented atoms as circles (for a graphene sheet) and depicted carbon-carbon bonds as lines.

## Functions in `nano_plot.py`
1. **find_connectivity**: 
2. **get_connectivity_ind**:
3. **plot_mesh**: 
4. **plot_carbon_carbon**: 

## Instructions
1. Set up the graphene sheet orientation as described.
2. Use the functions in `nano_plot.py` to visually depict the graphene sheet and carbon nanotube.
3. Observe the relationships between atoms and their connectivity in the constructed nanotube.

## Conclusion
This project provided a hands-on approach to understanding the structure and formation of carbon nanotubes from graphene sheets, emphasizing the importance of orientation and connectivity in their formation.
